"""
A zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given.
A triplet (P, Q, R) is triangular if it is possible to build a triangle with sides of lengths A[P], A[Q] and A[R].
In other words, triplet (P, Q, R) is triangular if 0 â‰¤ P < Q < R < N and:
    A[P] + A[Q] > A[R],
    A[Q] + A[R] > A[P],
    A[R] + A[P] > A[Q].

For example, consider array A such that:
  A[0] = 10    A[1] = 2    A[2] = 5
  A[3] = 1     A[4] = 8    A[5] = 12
There are four triangular triplets that can be constructed from elements of this array,
namely (0, 2, 4), (0, 2, 5), (0, 4, 5), and (2, 4, 5).


Write a function:   def solution(A)
that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of triangular triplets in this array.

For example, given array A such that:
  A[0] = 10    A[1] = 2    A[2] = 5
  A[3] = 1     A[4] = 8    A[5] = 12
the function should return 4, as explained above.


Assume that:
- N is an integer within the range [0..1,000];
- each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..1,000,000,000].

Complexity:
- expected worst-case time complexity is O(N2);
- expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
Elements of input arrays can be modified.
